# service_conf

this script is for service configurations for networking.

if you try to wireless attack then have to stop the service of network manager and somethings. however sometimes we forget commands... so I wrote the this simple and short script

copy or move this script to /usr/local/bin, then you can execute in any directory as general commands

ofcourse you can rename it
