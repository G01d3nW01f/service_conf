# service_conf

this script is for service configurations for networking.

if you tryed to wireless attack then have to stop the service of network manager and somethings.
however sometimes we forget commands...
so I wrote the this simple and short script

copy or move this script to /usr/local/bin,
ofcourse rename it you wanna do that
